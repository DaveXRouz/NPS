# Short-Term Memory

**Retention:** 7 days

## Purpose

Stores daily session notes, quick decisions, temporary findings, and iteration notes. These files capture the working context needed for session continuity over the short term.

## Retention Policy

- Files older than **7 days** should be reviewed during weekly cleanup
- Key decisions and learnings should be **promoted to long-term memory** before archival
- Routine session notes can be deleted after the retention period
- Update `../INDEX.md` when adding or removing files

## Usage

1. Copy `TEMPLATE_SESSION.md` to a new file: `YYYY-MM-DD_session_name.md`
2. Fill in the template during or after the session
3. Update `../INDEX.md` with the new session entry

## File Naming

```
YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive_name.md
```

**Examples:**

- `2026-02-08_phase1_db_schema.md`
- `2026-02-09_api_auth_setup.md`
