## Project State Summary

**Plan:** 45-session Oracle rebuild (hybrid approach)
**Strategy:** Keep infrastructure, rewrite Oracle logic
**Sessions completed:** 0 of 45
**Last session:** None — ready to begin
**Current block:** Foundation (Sessions 1-5)

---

## Pre-Build State (Before Session 1)

The 16-session scaffolding process produced 45,903 lines of code:

- Working database schema (PostgreSQL init.sql + migrations)
- API skeleton with 13 Oracle endpoints (FastAPI)
- Frontend with 20+ React components (Oracle UI, Persian keyboard, calendar)
- Oracle service structure with V3 engines copied in
- Integration tests (56+), Playwright E2E (8 scenarios)
- Docker Compose (7 containers), Dockerfiles, nginx config
- Auth middleware (JWT + API key), encryption (AES-256-GCM)

**What works:** Infrastructure, database, auth, encryption, basic API routing
**What needs rewrite:** Oracle engines, reading logic, AI interpretation, translation, frontend Oracle internals

## Session-to-Spec Mapping

The .specs/ folder contains specs from the 16-session scaffolding. They are REFERENCE ONLY — not execution targets. For the 45-session rebuild, sessions do NOT have pre-written specs. Instead:

- If a spec exists in .specs/ that covers similar ground → read it for context, then build your own plan
- If no spec exists → build plan from CLAUDE.md block descriptions + logic/ docs

| Block                  | Sessions | Focus                           | Relevant .specs/ (reference only)                    |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Foundation             | 1-5      | Database schema, auth, profiles | SPEC_T4_S1, SPEC_T2_S1, SPEC_T6_S1                   |
| Calculation Engines    | 6-12     | FC60, numerology, zodiac        | logic/FC60_ALGORITHM.md, logic/NUMEROLOGY_SYSTEMS.md |
| AI & Reading Types     | 13-18    | Wisdom AI, 5 reading flows      | SPEC_T3_S3                                           |
| Frontend Core          | 19-25    | Layout, Oracle UI, results      | SPEC_T1_S1 through S4                                |
| Frontend Advanced      | 26-31    | RTL, responsive, accessibility  | SPEC_T1_S3                                           |
| Features & Integration | 32-37    | Export, share, Telegram         | SPEC_INTEGRATION_S1                                  |
| Admin & DevOps         | 38-40    | Admin UI, monitoring, backup    | SPEC_T7_S1                                           |
| Testing & Deployment   | 41-45    | Tests, optimization, deploy     | SPEC_INTEGRATION_S2                                  |
